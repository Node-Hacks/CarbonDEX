## Problem
When we were younger, we used to think that one day, perhaps after a very long time, would the effects of global warming be perceptible.

But now when we look at how _astoundingly_ fast the global temperatures seem to be rising, it instills upon us a sense of urgency, a sense of responsibility towards our planet and our combined future.

It was exactly this responsibility that pushed us towards building something that people can use in their everyday lives to try and do their part in saving our planet. 

One way to achieve this is to keep people informed about the carbon footprint they leave behind in their everyday lives, so that they could shift towards a greener and more climate-friendly lifestyle.

## Solution

CarbonDex is an easy-to-use android application that helps you gain holistic insights into the carbon footprint that YOU and YOUR daily activities leave behind.

Planning a journey? Worry not because CarbonDex can track your journey and give you live-time insights on how much carbon footprint you left behind based on your vehicle's fuel consumption.

Want to know more about what carbon footprint is and how to do your part in saving the planet? CarbonDex has got your backs with its informative resources and guides on the same.

## About

CarbonDex provides a simple yet sophisticated UI with which the users can know more about how their daily activities impact the planet via the means of the carbon footprint that they leave behind. Users can also calculate the carbon footprint they leave behind on journeys using using Google Maps.

Although, we all had a lot of experience making web applications, we knew in our hearts that CarbonDex would really, truly help people only if it was a phone application, and so we sought out to build this project with no prior experience with only the ultimate benefit of people in our minds.

## Features and How We built it

_(( How we built it? We built it with almost zero experience! :P))_

CarbonDex is a mobile application built using Flutter and Dart whose main job is to calculate a person's carbon footprint based on their input.

We provide the various functionalities listed below:
- **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: The user has to answer a simple questionnaire which provides the application with data in order to calculate how much carbon footprint a person leaves behind.
-**Carbon Footprint in a Journey**: The application simply asks the user to input their vehicle's Fuel Consumption, which it then utilizes to provide the user with _real-time_ insights on the carbon footprint left behind in during a journey, using the Google Maps API.
-**Management and Getting to Know More**: The application can also be used to gain information on how the you can manage your carbon footprint. It also provides the users with additional information and resources that they can reference to gain further awareness regarding the topic.


## Challenges We ran into

Of us four, only one person had any previous experience making mobile applications. For almost the first 24 hours, we tried and failed to accomplish anything successful. Each step was a huge huddle which we had to overcome in the beginning. With only 12 hours left on the clock, and our project still in it's infancy, we all hyped each other up, and helped each other through, and finally got the project to where it is.                                     

## Accomplishments that We're proud of

For three of us, this was our very first mobile application! We learnt so much about the technologies and platforms involved and finished this hack with tons more experience under our belts than we had before.

But for us the biggest accomplishment remains that we made something that people can use in their everyday lives to do something for the betterment of the planet. We made something which furthers the agenda of sustainability, and informs and encourages everyone into doing their best for our Earth.

## What We learned

Tons and tons of new software and technologies of which we knew nothing before. Mobile application development is a domain none of us had explored much before so we broadened our knowledge's scope via this project, and came out the better for it.

Another thing we learnt was how to support our teammates, morally and technically, and work, learn and grow together.

Lastly, we gained ourselves got to know a lot about carbon footprint and what we can do to reduce it.

## What's next for CarbonDex

We hope to continue developing CarbonDex to become a better platform that supports cleaner and more uniform graphics.

The primary goal when we thought up the concept of CarbonDex was to build a platform that first and foremost addresses the need of taking urgent and immediate actions to stop, or at least slow down the rate of Global Warming. 

With this project we've set out to teach people about the ways in which they can contribute towards this cause. Hence we aim to continue developing this application further and incorporate various other related functionalities in it which will help people to indulge in our planet's wellbeing with a greater fervor.
